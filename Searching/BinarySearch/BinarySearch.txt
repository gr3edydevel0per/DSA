Time Complexity For Binary Search is
Worst Case - O(log n) |  Best Case - O(1) - found at mid
Why Binary Search is better than linear search
Linear Search            |   Binary Search
For 1 million elements   |  For 1m elements Iterationis log(1m)
Iteration is 1m          |  Iteration is 6



Worst case is the case when the the program took too long time to find the result
