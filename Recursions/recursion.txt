In order to terminate a recursive function we need a  terminating statement and this terminating statement is called baseCONDITIONS 
Or simply we can say that these are the conditions where recusrion stop maing new calls


If there is no base condiiton then the it will keep on calling itself and there will be a point when  the computer memory will exceed the limit
and it will give stack overflow error 

recursions - function calling itself
Why recursions?
it helps us solving bigger complex problem in easier way 
we can convert recurison solutions into iterations solutions and vice versa

Space complexity is no constant in case of recusrions  because each function call is taking some memory
example printing 1 to n numbers will have a complexity of O(n)
